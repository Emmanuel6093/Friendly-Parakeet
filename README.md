# Password Generator 

This is a password generator that generates a random password based on selected criteria by the user. 

## Instructions 

Click "Generate Password". 

When clicked the user will be asked to type in how many characters they would like in their password. If anything less than 8 characters is typed in then the user will be prompted to re-enter the amount of characters that is greater than/equal to 8. 

After that then the user will be prompted with selections that they can make. The selections will state whether or not they would like to include lowercase/uppercase letters, numeric values, & special symbols in their password. If the user chooses "Ok" then the selection WILL BE included in their password, if the user chooses "Cancel" then the selection WILL NOT be included in their password. 

Once all criteria is selected, the password will be displayed inside the box labeled "Your Secure Password".
